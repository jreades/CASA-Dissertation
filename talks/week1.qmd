# Planning

::: {.notes}
* **Part 1**: Set yourself up for success 
* **Part 2**: Write:
  * introductions
  * literature reviews 
  * methodologies
  * discussions
  * conclusions
  * tips
* **Part 3**: Use research language in relation to your thesis 
* **Part 4**: Plan your project 
:::

## Set (your) expectations 

What is your ultimate **goal**?

- What you want to do after your degree?
- What skills do think you might need do it?
- What mark do you need to achieve it?
- How hard do you want to work to achieve it?
- How can your dissertation demonstrate progress towards it?

You cannot expect a mark of 70% on effort of 30%.

## Set yourself up for success

<h2>So make a plan...<br />(But be adaptable when it changes!)</h2>

## Start anywhere...<br />just make sure you start!

- *How* do you work best?
- *Where* do you work best?
- *When* do you work best?

<h2>Writing is a *habit*.</h2>
:::

::: {.notes}
Writers are a very superstitious lot but what they're actually doing is using routines to prepare for the act of writing. You don't show up at the starting line expecting to run a marathon having not gotten off the sofa. Why should writing a dissertation be any different? You need to *train*!
:::

## What do(n't) you know?

It can be easy to list everything you **don't** know or **aren't** good at, so why not focus on:

- What interests you?
- What theories you know?
- What literature you know / have read?
- What tools you know?
- What methods you know?
- What datasets you know of / can find?

## Make connections!

Try to connect up what you *do* know through:

- A mind map
- A Miro board
- A Trello board
- Bullet points
- Literature review or summary

## Set your (reader's) expectations

Most papers and dissertations follow this structure:

- Introduction
- Literature Review 
- Methodology & Data
- Analysis/Results
- Discussion/Conclusion

::: {.notes}

By convention, you don't introduce new literature in the Discussion or Conclusion, and you don't introduce each methodology *while* doing the analysis. It *is* possible to deviate from this structure when the need arises, but be prepared for pushback if you do!

# Reading the field

Most staff members will say 

> *"you should read widely"*

... but what does this actually mean and why bother?

## Two types of reading

::: {.incremental}
1. Setting the scene reading
2. Technical reading
:::

## Setting the scene reading {.smaller}

Broader, often global, challenges, perhaps from a different discipline altogether. Commonly found in journals such as *Science*, *Nature* or (global) policy documents.

## Technical reading

The nitty gritty of the methods you want to apply:

* Where (e.g. journal, discipline, country, area, etc.)
* When (e.g. 1960s, 2020s, seasonally, etc.)
* How (e.g. comparatively, individually, sequentially, etc.)
* Why (e.g. to compare, to test, to hypothesise, etc.)

Also notice: 

* What (e.g. what has changed over time and across studies that have different data and methods)

## Additional considerations...

* The specific detail of your study area
* Local policy, socioeconomic, or geographic challenges
* More specialist journals and 'grey' literature

A broad introduction to the issue being explored to establish the *relevance* of your research.

Bluntly: why should I read your thesis?

::: {.notes}

Towards the end of the introduction links will be made to specific local case studies / literature

For example, in the London Plan temperature mitigation is specified but no methodological details are provided

## Introduction #1 {.smaller}

> Traffic safety problems are causing incommensurate harm to pedestrians in cities around the world (Bartolomeos et al. 2013). In the United States, 49,340 pedestrians were killed by moving vehicles between 2008 and 2017 (Zaccaro 2019). As walkability becomes more central in the minds of transportation planners, government officials, and citizens due to the corresponding advantages in the realms of health, wealth, and happiness (see section 2.1), it is critical that pedestrian traffic fatalities come to be seen not as inevitable accidents, but as ‘preventable and unacceptable’ occurrences (City of Charlotte DOT 2019, p. 8). Further, it is essential that burgeoning cities like Charlotte, North Carolina, where this study is focused, are able to grow in ways that are both sustainable and appealing. In such places, effectively addressing pedestrian safety and walkability will be one of the keys to future success. Accordingly, this goal is an important component of various global and local policies (see section 2.2).

## Introduction #2 {.smaller}

> Fire has always been a major unpredictable factor that presents a safety risk to people. Especially in the United Kingdom, which is a country where fires occur frequently. Throughout British history, many large-scale fires have caused irrevocable damage to London. Among them, the most famous fire was the Great Fire of London in 1666 (J. Carlson, 2005)，which lasted for four days before it was completely put out, making 70,000 people homeless and destroying thousands of medieval buildings. However, the only reason for that was a fire in the bakery. This shows that the fire is very contagious. For the government, it is imperative to detect a fire immediately and take corresponding measures as soon as possible.

## Spot the difference(s) 1

* Specific but *relevant* detail  
* Selling the relevance of the analysis 
* Consideration to the viewpoint of the terms..."not as inevitable accidents, but as ‘preventable and unacceptable"
* Reference to *specific* policy ...later expanded on

## End of introduction #1 {.smaller}

> Ultimately, this study intends to contribute to the field of traffic safety research by further investigating the possibilities for data-driven advocacy for pedestrian needs and solutions. In the words of the visionary Enrique Penalosa, ‘The essence of the conflict today, really, is cars and people...We can have a city that is very friendly to cars, or a city that is very friendly to people. We cannot have both’ (NYC Streets Renaissance 2006).

## End of introduction #2 {.smaller}

> In summary, this article will analyze the fire distribution and causes of fire
in London considering the time of the fire and the physical location
through a comprehensive analysis of the establishment of GIS and related
fire models to propose a suitable fire station location.

# The literature review

What has been done before and what you are hoping to contribute.

## Literature review #1 {.smaller}

> Jones et al. (2017) found an interesting relationship between tree canopy coverage and heart diseases. They concluded more trees should be planted where there is a higher prevalence of heart disease. Zhang et al. (2014) found no relationship between tree canopy coverage. Smith et al. (2007) showed that trees and lung disease were related.

This is just a list. Your job is to tell a story:

* What do studies show broadly are they similar or different
* How do studies advance each other
* What do they agree on 
* What do they disagree on
* Why do you think that is
* How can that be applied to your study.

:::

## Literature review #2 {.smaller}

> According to the World Health Organization, twenty-two percent of all road fatalities each year are pedestrians (Bartolomeos et al. 2013, p. vii). This unsettling statistic can perhaps be attributed to the rapid growth of urban centers, paired with a lack of effort to expand pedestrian facilities (Halais 2020). Indeed, pedestrian safety is a problem all over the world. In cities in sub-Saharan Africa, more than half of all trips occur by foot (Pendakur 2005, p. 10), yet pedestrians are regularly and disproportionately involved in incidents with motor vehicles due to a lack of sufficient walkways, lighting, and other helpful urban design provisions (Halais 2020, Murgu´ıa 2018). 

## Spot the difference(s) 3

* It's a story and you are guiding me through it....

# Reading methods+data

Not *just* a sequence of steps:

- Why *this* method and not *that* one
- What are the strengths
- What are the weaknesses
- How your results might differ/improve/challenge

## Methodology #1 {.smaller}

> The number of crashes were predicted per road segment using the selected negative binomial regression model and the predictions were compared to the true values, again using MAE, MSE, and RMSE. Where an observation was missing data, the required values were imputed using the rfImpute() function (Breiman 2003). The predicted crashes were mapped, with emphasis on the top 1% and top 25% most dangerous roads. Kumfer et al. (2019) used Empirical Bayes estimates to weight the predictions with historical crash data, but this step was omitted here. The authors write that the non-weighted predictions offer ‘a more holistic measure of pedestrian crash risk, given the uncertainty about future crash locations inherent in any crash prediction method’ (Kumfer et al. 2019, p. 427).

## Methodology #2 {.smaller}

> One of the objectives of this dissertation is to explore the relationship between nutrition, income, and obesity in the MSOA area of London. As regression analysis is the method that allows us to examine the relationship between two or more variables, regression analysis was used here to find the relationship between different factors with obesity (Foley, B, 2018). From the past literature, we can know there was a linear relationship between income, nutrition, physical activities, and obesity. So first we used the least square linear regression analysis to see if there are still linear relationships between influenced factors and obesity in geographic scale

## Spot the difference(s) 5

* Not much! 
* Both provide good literature support 
* Both give a clear overview.

# Analysing

## Results #1 {.smaller}

> Figures 4.3 and 4.4 display the actual crash data and the predicted number of crashes spatially. These visualizations show that the model predictions have captured roads that have been dangerous in the past, while also highlighting roads that should potentially be the focus of future concern. To further emphasize the unsafe areas highlighted by the model, the top 1% and top 25% most dangerous roads based on the number of predicted crashes were located and mapped (see figure 4.5). The actual and predicted crash statistics for the 6 roads in the top 1% most dangerous can be seen in table 4.4.

## Results #2 {.smaller}

> Result of K-means clustering analysis is shown as Figure 5.4 above and disadvantageous stations need to be identified based on the result for further optimisation. From Figure 5.4, it can be noticed that off-balancing scores of bike stations are likely to follow a positive correlation with their bike demand in both periods.

## Spot the difference(s) 6

* Clarity about what is going on
* The results aren't just stated, they are *interpreted* and then used to further the analysis
* What does the writing add that the figure doesn't? (Or vice versa) 

## Discussion 

Critically *reflect* on your results in relation to literature and policy: connect it back to the introduction / literature review. Not just the limitations of the project!

::: {.notes}

The discussion flips the funnel we saw earlier, you go from being specific about your project to broader contributions. We start with *you* and build back to the big picture!

- How do your methods / results differ to that of literature and policy
  - do they differ? 
  - why do you think that is?
- What is the point of your study / what can you suggest or recommend?
  - the point **IS NOT** to merely "support policy"
  - be really specific 
:::

## Discussion #1 {.smaller}

> As part of Charlotte’s work with Vision Zero, an online interactive feedback map was developed to allow citizens the opportunity to share concerns about traffic safety within the city (see figure 5.1). Griffin & Jiao find that the use of such digital technologies may introduce accessibility challenges and bias, but that ultimately, ‘Crowdsourcing tools can be valuable approaches to increase geography and equity of public participation in transportation planning’ (Griffin & Jiao 2019, p. 460). The Charlotte Vision Zero report explains: ‘The top five comments submitted related to traffic safety concerns were street design, speeding, lack of pedestrian facilities, failing to yield to pedestrians and drivers running stop signs and red lights’ (City of Charlotte DOT 2019, p. 22). The analysis conducted here has the potential to quantify the impact of changes to the built environment in terms of the number of pedestrian collisions, which could be a powerful tool for advocating for pedestrian needs in the city when combined with existing efforts such as the interactive map

## Discussion #2 {.smaller}

> The module “Document Management” provides ways to identify the change of information effectively. In the case study, the structural team members can find out what modification has been added in the model file by the architectural team, they can compare the versions of the model and all the additional features will be highlighted as Figure 11

## Spot the difference(s) 7

* Demonstrates links to current policy
* Clearly states what the contribution is and how it is useful
* Identifies a relevant interactive map and again, suggests how it could be improved or combined.
* Reflects on relation to literature and or policy

## Conclusion

If you read *nothing* else...

* Briefly restate what you set out to achieve 
* Briefly say how you did it
* Briefly summarise the main results
* *Explain* hhow this can contribute to future policy and/or literature

::: {.notes}

* No new material or references are in the conclusion

:::

## Conclusion #1 {.smaller}

> Improving walkability is gaining traction as an essential strategy for achieving economic, public health and sustainability goals in cities worldwide. The newfound appreciation for walkability has coincided with concern about effectively facilitating safe walking journeys. While data-driven analysis methods have long been used to study vehicular traffic, such methods are only recently being applied to pedestrian problems

## Conclusion #2 {.smaller}

> This study mainly explores and discusses the effects of various commuting types on
the obesity rate. Dividing 9 commuting types into 3, this study analyses the relationship between commuting and obesity by three methodologies, linear regression, K-means clustering and geographically weighted regression. The result demonstrates that carled commuting is highly correlative to the obesity rate, and non-car commuting only can slightly allay the situation of rapidly elevated obesity rate caused by car-led commuting

## Spot the difference(s) 8

* Don't just say what you did
* Don't undermine your results right at the *end*
* Link your findings back to policy or bigger problems, and asses how it does (or doesn't!) solve the problem

# The big picture

## Your research is... {.smaller}

- **Original:** you need to write the assignment in your own words in a way that tells a narrative through the existing research. Don’t just state what others have done 
- **Coherent:** make your points in a logical, sequential manner with support from literature (or policy documents). Don’t just assume the reader knows what you are talking about. 
- **Insightful:** show that you understand the methods, concepts and debates, and also how your analysis (or discussion) did or could add meaning in some way. 

## Your research will... {.smaller}

- **Address a gap:** identify and discuss the relevant existing work and lead the reader to the gap (and its importance) 
- **Make a contribution:** once you’ve identified the gap, be specific throughout your thesis about what you are contributing.^[This thesis attempts to combine these two datasets FOR THIS REASON...]
- **Be novel:** clearly say what is new; this could be a new method, a new study area, or a bit of both (or mix too).

## Note the mark scheme! {.smaller}

> Interpretations of results are very well constructed, clear and focused with a well developed narrative throughout. The discussion provides appropriate critical reflections on the project’s outcomes, strengths and limitations with good links to relevant academic and policy (if applicable) debates.

## The research question {.smaller}

The central question to the thesis that you will try to answer

> How might longitudinal census data and resale prices of residential properties lend insight into spatial patterns of potential neighbourhood gentrification prompted by conserved built heritage in Singapore?


## The research aim {.smaller}

The more specific you are with it the easier it will be to undertake your project^[Is a broad statement of intent that you will try and achieve within your thesis, it may simply be *the research question rephrased*.]:

> This paper aims to critically examine typologies of neighbourhood change in order to provide insight into different pathways of neighbourhood transition in Singapore, while constructing an effective visualisation of Singapore’s gentrification landscape to aid spatial targeting of policy-making.

## The research objectives {.smaller}

Often confused with research questions, but they are driven *by* the research question...^[Note: singular.] For example:

> What features of the built environment are thought to influence pedestrian safety, and can our understanding of these relationships be strengthened?

## SMART objectives {.smaller}

Research objectives are the set of measurable and specific goals you need to achieve your aim / research question. It’s good practice (but not essential) fto follow the S.M.A.R.T. format:

- **S**pecific
- **M**easurable
- **A**chievable
- **R**elevant
- **T**ime-Bound

## Ultimately: what are you selling?

![](img/van.jpg) 


# Top tips 

## It's a job {.smaller}

- **Study in chunks**: research a particular topic for a set amount of time - a day, two days, a week? Depending on how important that topic is to your dissertation 
- **Plan** - what do you want to achieve today
- **Reflect** - did you do it? why not? was it too ambitious? was the task bigger than you thought
- **Adjust** - use the new knowledge you've gained, can you now adjust your research question or topic even?
- **Is it useful** - do you need this? What is it contributing? 
- **Don't read everything** - there is so much out there, at some point you need to stop, when is that? 

## Organise your literature {.smaller}

- [ ] Choose articles and book chapters over books.
- [ ] Skim the abstract, introduction and conclusion *first*.
- [ ] Save useful material (including the citation) to your computer *as you go*.
- [ ] Write a summary of the literature *as you read it*.
- [ ] Copy out relevant quotes with page numbers *as you read them*.

## Organise your writing {.smaller}

- [ ] Start each chapter with a paragraph setting out what you're going to do. 
- [ ] End each chapter with a couple of paragraphs *summarising* what you've done. 
- [ ] Make use of headings / sub-headings / sub-sub-headings to organise a chapter.
- [ ] Each paragraph should focus on one concept / issue / method.
- [ ] Each section should focus on one set of *related* concepts / issues / methods.
- [ ] Use linking words such as 'Conversely', 'Furthermore', 'However' as appropriate.
- [ ] Use plain-English in preference to 'academese'.

## Organise your analysis  {.smaller}

- [ ] *Use* version control for *everything*!
- [ ] Use the `README` to track data/as a scratchpad.
- [ ] You *could* also use GitHub Issues to track what needs doing.
- [ ] Separate your analytical steps into discrete scripts/notebooks.
- [ ] Ensure outputs are clearly named and over-write previous versions^[Never rely on copy+paste.].

::: {.notes}
Remember! You can write out tables as well as figures. In LaTeX these can be imported directly.

:::

## Organise your figures/tables  {.smaller}

- [ ] Are they relevant to your argument?
- [ ] Can you summarise the figure or table in a sentence or two instead?
- [ ] What level of precision in your output do you need?
- [ ] Are they all referenced in the text? 
- [ ] Are they clearly laid out?

## Manage your time {.smaller}

- [ ] Send your supervisor work before meetings.^[This is a condition to meet with me.]
- [ ] Ask questions the 'right way'.^[See the [How to Get Help](https://jreades.github.io/sds_env/skills/help.html) section of the 'CASA Computing Environment' microsite.]
- [ ] Do NOT try and do an internship at the same time.^[You risk violating the terms of your visa *and* failing your dissertation.]
- [ ] Keep in touch with your supervisor...^[If you disappear we have to report it to student support wellbeing and success advisers. Again, this can put your visa at risk.]
