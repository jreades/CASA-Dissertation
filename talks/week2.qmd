# The introduction

Usually very few headings:

- Introduction
- Research question
- Objectives 
- Outline

# The literature review

You will likely have a 2 or 3 main headings within the literature review and sub headings exploring specifics:

- What affects it?
- Who decided that it is this way? On what basis?
- How is it defined? Do definitions vary based on location or other factors?
- How is it measured? 
- How has it been studied before?

<h3>A 'tour' of the literature to establish your contribution!</h3>

## Literature review 1 {.smaller}

Can features of the built environment be used to predict the locations of pedestrian crashes at the street level in Uptown Charlotte, North Carolina?

- Benefits of Walking
- Pedestrian Safety Pandemic 
  - Pedestrian Policies, Globally and Locally
  - Factors Influencing Pedestrian Safety
- Pedestrian Data Dilemmas
- Methods for Considering Pedestrian Safety

## Literature review 2 {.smaller}

Can we prioritize road segments for investments in segregated cycling infrastructure, doing so in a way that makes optimal use of limited budgets?

- What affects the decision to cycle?
  - Existence of Segregated Cycling Infrastructure
  - Directness
  - Continuity and Density
  - Overarching Policies
- Planning Cycling Networks?
  - Connected Components
  - Optimization
  - Directness
  - Optimization based on Community Detection

## What is new? 

Only by demonstrating you've 'done your homework' can you convince me that you've found something 'new'!

# Methodology {.smaller}

Think logically, a reader needs to know:

- What data you have access to / used
- Any data processing you have done
- Any ethical concerns about the data
- What method(s) you will use and why
- How you use both together 

Start with a high level overview!

## Headings {.smaller}

- Study Area
- Data (and limitations?)
- Ethical considerations
- Methods
  - Random forest 
  - Negative Binomial Regression
  - Prediction and Interpretation 
  - Measuring error

## Notes on the study area {.smaller}

- Is your study area unique?
- Are you trying to address a specific policy or metropolitan challenge that is associated with that city?
- Does it have a history of trying to solve the issue or failures in attempting to address it
- Is there specific data for your city that is better/new/different? 
- Has there been a sudden local interest from policy 

You probably *don't* need one if you are creating a new method...^[Pro tip: you're probably not creating a new method.]

# Conclusion vs abstract 

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/2ts0GOm9Laawo/giphy.gif)

# The Abstact 

The abstract is always much shorter and can be created by following a few simple steps:

- State what challenge you are trying to solve, perhaps with a sentence or two of context before it.
- State what method you use
- State what the results show
- State what the paper recommends based on the data

# The Conclusion

The conclusion is longer and should reflect on if the aim(s) and objectives were met. It is similar to the abstract but has much more detail. 

- Restate what you set out to investigate
- Summarise how you achieved the
- Summarise the results 
- Reflect if you meet the aims + objectives
- State the importance 
- Give some high level, specifc, recommendations


## Compare...

In this example I would have liked to see some more actionable recommedations as opposed to..

>  Future work should also more comprehensively investigate appropriate baseline levels of maintenance activity, for example by following the approach detailed here to quantify maintenance in areas of known high data quality

# Documentation

## Word

- Use a reference manager - Zotero
- Install the Word plugin 
- When you download the paper into Zotero make sure all the details are correct, it will save you time later when populating the reference list. 
- Back up your files, Word will crash and you might lose it all

## Word 2.0

- Set paragraph and character styles and *use* them.
- Use numbered headings
- Use 'insert caption' for figures and tables
- Use 'insert cross-reference' rather than typing them out^[If the cross reference numbers aren't updating, control + P [print] then cancel and they will!]

## Table of contents

- Auto-insert table of contents (adjust to level 1 and 2 only)
- Auto-insert table of figures
- Auto-insert table of tables

## Advanced formatting

- Make use of breaks, widow and orphan control, etc. to manage flow
- Can be useful to create custom styles to enable different formatting on different sections - e.g. title page, abstract and then contents
- *May* be worth a Master document and embedding child documents (but frustration ahead!)
- When you finish your thesis use **Save as Adobe PDF** (*not* Print + Save as PDF) - this means the PDF document has bookmarks that can be clicked


# Other Approaches {.smaller}

All of these will provide a higher-quality, more robust output with more flexible layouts and *proper* equation typesetting... but the biggest advantage is that they all encourage to focus on *writing* when used effectively.

1. Markdown+Quarto
   - Pros: supports Python and lots of annoying things from bookdown have been fixed.
   - Cons: fewer examples of how to write a thesis.
2. Markdown+Bookdown
   - Pros: copy Andy's template
   - Cons: only in R
3. LaTeX
   - Pros: the full-featured typesetting engine (you want Tufte, you got it!)
   - Cons: the full-featured typesetting engine (you also get gnomic error messages!)
